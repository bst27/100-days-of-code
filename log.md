# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 4: August 15, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the second project for the "Responsive Web Design
Certification" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and spent the rest of the day
working on a solution to improve the deployment of my static websites to AWS S3. 

**Thoughts**: I am not satisfied with my progress today, because I spent too much time on
improving my AWS S3 deployment. I hope this will pay off and save me time in the future. At
least I have a good solution now which is automated, less error-prone and greatly simplifies
defining custom metadata (headers) on S3 objects.

### Day 3: August 14, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I completed 3 courses at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/):
"Applied Accessibility", "Responsive Web Design Principles" and "CSS Grid" of the
"Responsive Web Design Certification". Furthermore, I completed the first project at this
certification and created a tribute page about Elon Musk. In addition I created an app to
forward contact form submissions via webhook.

**Thoughts**: I learned a lot in the 3 courses at freeCodeCamp. They were easy but I just
had forgotten so many things and it was a good refresh. I am also very happy about how the
browser support for all these cool features has improved. It got obvious I worked more at
backend code than with frontend code in recent time.

### Day 2: August 13, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I created an app to notify about filesystem changes via webhooks.
I also completed "Basic HTML and HTML5", "Basic CSS" and "Applied Visual Design" of the
"Responsive Web Design Certification" from the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: I wrote more code than yesterday and could reuse some code to speedup 
project setup. The first freeCodeCamp courses were pretty easy, but I wanted to start at
the beginning. The course about "Applied Visual Design" was very helpful to refresh my
design knowledge, especially color theory, linear-gradient(), repeating-linear-gradient(),
transform and all about css animations and keyframes.

### Day 1: August 12, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I created an app for dynamic wallpapers. 

**Thoughts**: This was pretty easy. I did not write much code actually. Most of the time
was spent [upgrading](https://golang.org/doc/install) my local Go version, investigating the
[golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout),
writing a build script to create [executables for multiple platforms](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-go-executables-for-multiple-platforms-on-ubuntu-16-04)
and checking the code of the dependencies I used in the app. I also learned where Windows
stores the wallpaper files ("TranscodedWallpaper").
