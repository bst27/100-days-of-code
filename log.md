# 100 Days Of Code - Log

If you are interested in my coding journey feel free to visit my coding diary at:

https://www.digitalpush.net/en/100-days-of-code/

### Day 24: September 04, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I totally went down the rabbit hole. All started with thinking about how
to manage state in my Angular [app](https://github.com/bst27/plaudern) for managing static website comments,

**Thoughts**: I think it is quite distressing how bad many websites, web apps and especially single page apps (SPAs)
fail at managing state. There are so many pitfalls and race conditions under the hood waiting to occur. My experience is
that even software developers with a few years experience are often not aware of the problems caused by failing at managing
state. I think I should definitely write a blog post about this topic on my [blog](https://www.digitalpush.net/en/) or
at least publish a resource list with great existing articles to read about managing state.

### Day 23: September 03, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I added [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) to my 
[app](https://github.com/bst27/plaudern) for managing static website comments. Additionally,
I made some progress at the "Basic Algorithm Scripting" chapter of the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
Certification" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: It has been really easy to start using Angular Material in an existing Angular project. The docs
are quite good. Thanks to Twitter I found more helpful websites like Indie Hackers or the Hemingway App today.

### Day 22: September 02, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I mainly worked on my [app](https://github.com/bst27/plaudern) for managing static website
comments: I added support to sanitize user input, improved the Angular development environment for faster development by
adding a proxy config, improved the styling of the webinterface and added routing to show comment details. Additionally,
I published a blog post: [How to run a local webserver in seconds](https://www.digitalpush.net/en/how-to-run-a-webserver-in-seconds/).
I will use the evening for some progress at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: I really enjoy working with PhpStorm and Angular. The learning curve is not too steep for me. Of course,
I already have years of experience in web development and worked with TypeScript before. But I think the Angular docs
and the CLI with code generation greatly simplify everything.

### Day 21: September 01, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I added support to receive comments via an HTTP endpoint in the [Angular](https://angular.io/)
frontend of my [app](https://github.com/bst27/plaudern) for managing static website comments and published a blog
post about [72+ Great Sources for Web Icons](https://www.digitalpush.net/en/great-sources-for-free-web-icons/). I will
use the evening for some progress at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

### Day 20: August 31, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the "Debugging" chapter of the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
Certification" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). In addition, I worked on the
[Angular](https://angular.io/) frontend of my [app](https://github.com/bst27/plaudern) for managing static website
comments and added support to show comments.

**Thoughts**: Thanks to Angular I had my first contact to [RxJS](https://www.learnrxjs.io/) and its observables and operators.

### Day 19: August 30, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I added an [Angular](https://angular.io/) frontend to my
[app](https://github.com/bst27/plaudern) for managing static website
comments and finished the "Regular Expressions" chapter of the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
Certification" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: I like that many popular frameworks like Angular or React nowadays come with a CLI to
initialize new projects and generate code scaffolds.

### Day 18: August 29, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the [Angular](https://angular.io/) tutorials about routing, data handling
and forms and will use the evening to learn about deployment. I also made some progress in the "Regular Expressions"
section of the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: I have written down some ideas for blog posts which came to my mind because of questions on Twitter. For
a long time I did not really understand the hype about Twitter but recently I started to like it, especially after 
diving deeper into the dev community. I also appreciate how international it is compared to Facebook, Instagram etc. It
is really easy to get in contact with people interested in the same topic from all around the world.

### Day 17: August 28, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I added multi-language support to my [website](https://www.digitalpush.net/) and made
some progress in the "Regular Expressions" section of the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification"
at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: I am excited to see how my multi-language website will perform in the next months. I am running websites
in German language for German visitors for years but have no experience with international traffic.

### Day 16: August 27, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the "ES6" section of the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification"
and started with "Regular Expressions" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). I also started with
[Angular](https://angular.io/) and created the sample app. 

**Thoughts**: Thanks to Twitter I found [Responsively](https://responsively.app/), an app which greatly
simplifies developing responsive websites and started backing it via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/).

**Today's Progress**: Today I added the first actions to my app
for managing static website comments and made some progress on the
"JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification"
at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: Did some thoughts about "code as a liability"
because of a short question on Twitter.

**Today's Progress**: Today I started developing an app to manage comments
for static websites and made some progress on the "JavaScript Algorithms
and Data Structures Certification" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: I had not much time to do some personal programming today.
Nevertheless, I did at least a little programming in the late evening and
during a train drive.

### Day 9: August 20, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I made some changes to my static website generator to support
multi-language websites and page redirects. I also started to move some pages of my website
and created redirects to prepare it for multi-language content. Will use the evening for
some progress on my [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) certification.

**Thoughts**: Time is really running today.

### Day 8: August 19, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the "Basic Javascript" chapter of the "JavaScript Algorithms
and Data Structures Certification" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and read some
articles about recursion and how to think recursively. I also restructured some of my Golang
projects according to another [project layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).

**Thoughts**: Thinking recursively is still one of the tougher challenges for me. My thoughts start
running in circles and my brain starts cooking.

### Day 7: August 18, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I refined my profile at various job portals for freelancers. I also learned
about [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and created a
workflow to build a project and publish artifacts. I will use the evening to complete a few steps in the
"JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
P.S.: Published my [Gitea backup script for docker](https://gist.github.com/bst27/1bf1590c5ec0b8b1c331d2a03e237894).

**Thoughts**: Feels like the job market for IT freelancers in Germany has been hit by Corona.

### Day 6: August 17, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I created an app to get sunrise and sunset times via
an HTTP API. I also started with the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
Certification" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), read multiple
articles which compared [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
and [Angular](https://angular.io/) and spruced my profile
at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

**Thoughts**: Although React and Vue.js have far more stars at
[Github](https://github.com/) than Angular I still prefer Angular because
the job market for Angular seems better, it's backed by Google and it's a complete
solution in a single package - perfect to get work done. It also uses
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and having a type system is
a good thing in my experience.

### Day 5: August 16, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I solved 3 more projects and finally completed 
the "Responsive Web Design Certification" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: I am satisfied with the project results and happy to have the certification
completed. Slowly it started to become boring, and I wanted to try something new.

### Day 4: August 15, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the second project for the "Responsive Web Design
Certification" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and spent the rest of the day
working on a solution to improve the deployment of my static websites to AWS S3. 

**Thoughts**: I am not satisfied with my progress today, because I spent too much time on
improving my AWS S3 deployment. I hope this will pay off and save me time in the future. At
least I have a good solution now which is automated, less error-prone and greatly simplifies
defining custom metadata (headers) on S3 objects.

### Day 3: August 14, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I completed 3 courses at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/):
"Applied Accessibility", "Responsive Web Design Principles" and "CSS Grid" of the
"Responsive Web Design Certification". Furthermore, I completed the first project at this
certification and created a tribute page about Elon Musk. In addition I created an app to
forward contact form submissions via webhook.

**Thoughts**: I learned a lot in the 3 courses at freeCodeCamp. They were easy but I just
had forgotten so many things and it was a good refresh. I am also very happy about how the
browser support for all these cool features has improved. It got obvious I worked more at
backend code than with frontend code in recent time.

### Day 2: August 13, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I created an app to notify about filesystem changes via webhooks.
I also completed "Basic HTML and HTML5", "Basic CSS" and "Applied Visual Design" of the
"Responsive Web Design Certification" from the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: I wrote more code than yesterday and could reuse some code to speedup 
project setup. The first freeCodeCamp courses were pretty easy, but I wanted to start at
the beginning. The course about "Applied Visual Design" was very helpful to refresh my
design knowledge, especially color theory, linear-gradient(), repeating-linear-gradient(),
transform and all about css animations and keyframes.

### Day 1: August 12, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I created an app for dynamic wallpapers. 

**Thoughts**: This was pretty easy. I did not write much code actually. Most of the time
was spent [upgrading](https://golang.org/doc/install) my local Go version, investigating the
[golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout),
writing a build script to create [executables for multiple platforms](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-go-executables-for-multiple-platforms-on-ubuntu-16-04)
and checking the code of the dependencies I used in the app. I also learned where Windows
stores the wallpaper files ("TranscodedWallpaper").
