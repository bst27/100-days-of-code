# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 12, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I created an app for dynamic wallpapers. 

**Thoughts**: This was pretty easy. I did not write much code actually. Most of the time
was spent [upgrading](https://golang.org/doc/install) my local Go version, investigating the
[golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout),
writing a build script to create [executables for multiple platforms](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-go-executables-for-multiple-platforms-on-ubuntu-16-04)
and checking the code of the dependencies I used in the app. I also learned where Windows
stores the wallpaper files ("TranscodedWallpaper").
