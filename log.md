# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 17: August 28, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I added multi-language support to my [website](https://www.digitalpush.net/) and made
some progress in the "Regular Expressions" section of the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification"
at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: I am excited to see how my multi-language website will perform in the next months. I am running websites
in German language for German visitors for years but have no experience with international traffic.

### Day 16: August 27, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the "ES6" section of the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification"
and started with "Regular Expressions" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). I also started with
[Angular](https://angular.io/) and created the sample app. 

**Thoughts**: Thanks to Twitter I found [Responsively](https://responsively.app/), an app which greatly
simplifies developing responsive websites and started backing it via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/).

### Day 15: August 26, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on my app for managing static website comments: I made the database configurable,
added an author field for comments and support to notify about new comments via webhook. I also made some progress 
at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: No thoughts today.

### Day 13: August 24, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I made some progress on the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification"
at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and worked on my app for managing static website comments:
Comments are available to the frontend now and I also added support for cross-origin requests.

**Thoughts**: Rate limiting on a bigger scale is quite an interesting topic.

**Thoughts**: Read some good articles about handling persistence
in general and handling persistence in Go specifically.

for managing static website comments and made some progress on the
"JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification"
at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: Did some thoughts about "code as a liability"
because of a short question on Twitter.

### Day 10: August 21, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started developing an app to manage comments
for static websites and made some progress on the "JavaScript Algorithms
and Data Structures Certification" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: I had not much time to do some personal programming today.
Nevertheless, I did at least a little programming in the late evening and
during a train drive.

### Day 9: August 20, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I made some changes to my static website generator to support
multi-language websites and page redirects. I also started to move some pages of my website
and created redirects to prepare it for multi-language content. Will use the evening for
some progress on my [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) certification.

**Thoughts**: Time is really running today.

### Day 8: August 19, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the "Basic Javascript" chapter of the "JavaScript Algorithms
and Data Structures Certification" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and read some
articles about recursion and how to think recursively. I also restructured some of my Golang
projects according to another [project layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).

**Thoughts**: Thinking recursively is still one of the tougher challenges for me. My thoughts start
running in circles and my brain starts cooking.

### Day 7: August 18, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I refined my profile at various job portals for freelancers. I also learned
about [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and created a
workflow to build a project and publish artifacts. I will use the evening to complete a few steps in the
"JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
P.S.: Published my [Gitea backup script for docker](https://gist.github.com/bst27/1bf1590c5ec0b8b1c331d2a03e237894).

**Thoughts**: Feels like the job market for IT freelancers in Germany has been hit by Corona.

### Day 6: August 17, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I created an app to get sunrise and sunset times via
an HTTP API. I also started with the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
Certification" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), read multiple
articles which compared [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
and [Angular](https://angular.io/) and spruced my profile
at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

**Thoughts**: Although React and Vue.js have far more stars at
[Github](https://github.com/) than Angular I still prefer Angular because
the job market for Angular seems better, it's backed by Google and it's a complete
solution in a single package - perfect to get work done. It also uses
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and having a type system is
a good thing in my experience.

### Day 5: August 16, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I solved 3 more projects and finally completed 
the "Responsive Web Design Certification" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: I am satisfied with the project results and happy to have the certification
completed. Slowly it started to become boring, and I wanted to try something new.

### Day 4: August 15, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the second project for the "Responsive Web Design
Certification" at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and spent the rest of the day
working on a solution to improve the deployment of my static websites to AWS S3. 

**Thoughts**: I am not satisfied with my progress today, because I spent too much time on
improving my AWS S3 deployment. I hope this will pay off and save me time in the future. At
least I have a good solution now which is automated, less error-prone and greatly simplifies
defining custom metadata (headers) on S3 objects.

### Day 3: August 14, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I completed 3 courses at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/):
"Applied Accessibility", "Responsive Web Design Principles" and "CSS Grid" of the
"Responsive Web Design Certification". Furthermore, I completed the first project at this
certification and created a tribute page about Elon Musk. In addition I created an app to
forward contact form submissions via webhook.

**Thoughts**: I learned a lot in the 3 courses at freeCodeCamp. They were easy but I just
had forgotten so many things and it was a good refresh. I am also very happy about how the
browser support for all these cool features has improved. It got obvious I worked more at
backend code than with frontend code in recent time.

### Day 2: August 13, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I created an app to notify about filesystem changes via webhooks.
I also completed "Basic HTML and HTML5", "Basic CSS" and "Applied Visual Design" of the
"Responsive Web Design Certification" from the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Thoughts**: I wrote more code than yesterday and could reuse some code to speedup 
project setup. The first freeCodeCamp courses were pretty easy, but I wanted to start at
the beginning. The course about "Applied Visual Design" was very helpful to refresh my
design knowledge, especially color theory, linear-gradient(), repeating-linear-gradient(),
transform and all about css animations and keyframes.

### Day 1: August 12, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I created an app for dynamic wallpapers. 

**Thoughts**: This was pretty easy. I did not write much code actually. Most of the time
was spent [upgrading](https://golang.org/doc/install) my local Go version, investigating the
[golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout),
writing a build script to create [executables for multiple platforms](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-go-executables-for-multiple-platforms-on-ubuntu-16-04)
and checking the code of the dependencies I used in the app. I also learned where Windows
stores the wallpaper files ("TranscodedWallpaper").
